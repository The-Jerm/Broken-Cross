 rma_nizari_ta_wli_desc: "The Quran is often used as an instruction manual for legal jurisprudence like how one might read a manual for horses. Yet this practice exaggerates (Ghulat) the importance of the naked word and diminishes the deeper spiritual and esoteric meaning behind them. Thus we have dedicated much time and have many scholars producing works explaining this brilliance about the recitations."

 rma_kontra_l_insara_desc: "The northern Italian states, the remnants of the once fearsome Lombard kingdom, have never forgotten the loss of Rome the sacred city and cultural pearl of their civilization.

 rma_public_representives_desc: "The Italians have never allowed their "Romance" for the days gone by to settle and can be seen in almost every aspect of daily life in some way.

Following 1 year-long siege of the city, the emir and the citizens came to an arrangement that the city was to elect its own magistrates to oversee and arbitrate the local laws and customs in return the emir demanded that all the citizens accepted Islam into their hearts and the rebels agreed."

Thirdly and finally it gave us a constant traffic of pilgrims wishing to visit the Christian holy places and willing to pay to do so."
 rma_christian_condottieri: "Christian Condottieri"
 rma_christian_condottieri_desc: "In spite of what one might imagine the Christians coming down from the north aren't all hostile rather many of them are looking for employment in particular as mercenaries. These Condoterrieri are companies of hired soldiers that hold no sway over the public or influence among the nobility making them loyal soldiers when employed as guards or as a standing core of the army, as long as we pay in time."
 rma_imamate_of_rome: "Imamate of Rome"
 rma_imamate_of_rome_desc: "The conversion of Rome and the years of incorporation into dar al-Islam has lead to the creation of an institution that has rendered Islam a familiar rather than an alien presence of the Europeans.
